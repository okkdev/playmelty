# Play Melty Blood

Website to get people to try Melty Blood

I experimented with features like portals. -> Code is weird lol

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
